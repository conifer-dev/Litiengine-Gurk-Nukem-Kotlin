# Kotlin Gurk Nukem
A very simple and straightforward unfinished Gurk Nukem written in Kotlin by following the official tutorial on [Litiengine website](https://litiengine.com/docs/tutorials/creating-a-platformer/#chapter-1-the-first-level).
# It's purpose and why
The overall project structure has deviated from the original as my preference. I've decided to create this simple example to show people how Litiengine would look like using Kotlin and the fact that it does indeed work perfectly fine as it should! but also to show how to set one up with Kotlin & Kotlin DSL.
Kotlin version has few differences, most notably the usage of objects as singletons.

You can also download the AppImage for Linux that should work on any Linux distro with or without JVM as it was packaged with **jpackage** that includes jre which also explains its overall size.
